# Cursor Task List

## High Impact TODOs
1. Implement mouse‑parallax layers in Hero in addition to Stars.
2. Add 404.html fallback copy from index.html to support SPA deep links on Pages.
3. Create `public/cv/edris-jebran-cv.pdf` and wire download button.
4. Improve accessibility (landmarks, aria labels).
5. Add unit tests for timeline rendering.

## Prompts
- "Refactor HeroSection to include a holographic 3D sphere that reacts to mouse position (r3f)."
- "Create a useParallax hook to translate layers based on pointer and scroll."
- "Polish mobile layout: tighten paddings on small screens and ensure 40–44px tap targets."
