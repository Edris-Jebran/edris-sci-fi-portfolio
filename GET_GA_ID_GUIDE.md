## Important Notes

- It doesn't contain any personal information
- It only identifies your Google Analytics property

### Data Collection
- Data starts collecting immediately after setup
- First data appears in real-time reports within minutes
- Full reports take 24-48 hours to populate

### Multiple Websites
- You can use the same property for multiple websites
- Each website gets its own data stream
- Each stream has a unique Measurement ID

## Security Best Practices

1. **Don't share your tracking ID publicly** (though it's not sensitive)
2. **Use HTTPS** for your website (required for GA4)
3. **Respect user privacy** with cookie consent
4. **Regularly review** your data collection practices
